1. factory design
   very much used

exmaple
create a vehicle bike car bus
if else in main class to create new vehicle so it hampers main file everytime
it is very tighly coupled so we will create a factory 

so we create a createFactory function and import it in main and add in this factory so main file doesn't change

so the logic is now at factory and not in main vehicle
